[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-website/releases).


#### Create s3 website bucket

```hcl
module "website" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-website.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"
  hostname  = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"

  deployment_arns = {
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal1" = ["/prefix1", "/prefix2"]
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal2" = [""]
  }
}
```


#### Create S3 website bucket with Route53 DNS

Required one of the `parent_zone_id` or `parent_zone_name`

```hcl
module "website_with_cname" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-website.git?ref=master"
  namespace      = "eg"
  stage          = "prod"
  name           = "app"
  hostname       = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"
  parent_zone_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
