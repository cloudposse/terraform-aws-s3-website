Terraform module to provision S3-backed Websites.
**IMPORTANT:** This module provisions a globally accessible S3 bucket for unauthenticated users because it is designed for hosting public static websites. Normally, AWS recommends that S3 buckets should not publicly accessible in order to protect S3 data from unauthorized users.

We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


#### Create s3 website bucket

```hcl
module "website" {
  source = "cloudposse/s3-website/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"
  hostname  = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"

  deployment_arns = {
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal1" = ["/prefix1", "/prefix2"]
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal2" = [""]
  }
}
```


#### Create S3 website bucket with Route53 DNS

Required one of the `parent_zone_id` or `parent_zone_name`

```hcl
module "website_with_cname" {
  source = "cloudposse/s3-website/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace      = "eg"
  stage          = "prod"
  name           = "app"
  hostname       = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"
  parent_zone_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
