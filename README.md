Terraform module to provision S3-backed Websites


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

#### Create s3 website bucket

```hcl
module "website" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-website.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"
  hostname  = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"

  deployment_arns = {
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal1" = ["/prefix1", "/prefix2"]
    "arn:aws:s3:::principal2" = [""]
  }
}
```


#### Create S3 website bucket with Route53 DNS

Required one of the `parent_zone_id` or `parent_zone_name`

```hcl
module "website_with_cname" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-s3-website.git?ref=master"
  namespace      = "cp"
  stage          = "prod"
  name           = "app"
  hostname       = "docs.prod.cloudposse.org"
  parent_zone_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```
